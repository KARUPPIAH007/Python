DataTypes:
    Are the categorization or classification of data items
    It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a parrticular data

Built in DataTypes:
    Numeric Integer,float and complex
    Sequence type: string,list and tuple
    Boolean
    Set
    Dictonary

Mutable and Imutable objects:
    1.Mutable objects can change their state or content
    Ex:list,dict,Set
    2.Imutable objects cannot change their state or content
    Ex:Numeric,Float,Boolean,string,Tuple
list:
-> mutable objects
-> is a Sequence data type which is used to store collection of data
-> ordered
tuple
-> immutable objects
-> used to store the values
-> ordered

# String 
    -> sequence of character
    -> create a string using single ,double quote or for multiline statement we use """ """

range() -> number of sequence
start-> default0
stop -> excluded
step-> default 1

while
--> while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly untill a given condition is satisfied.
--> when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the given program is excuted
# syntax:
while(expression);
loop body

# Membership operator
-> in (true) - if values is not in the sequence
-> not in (true) - if values is not found in the sequence
--> used to test whether a value or varaiable is in a sequence

Dictonary:
-> A Dictonary is a collection of key value particular
-> Here,each key is connected to a value
-> use a key to access the value
-> key should be unique

set:
-> collection of items
-> enclosed in {}
-> each element is separated
-> Unordered 
-> Mutable
-> Unique
